Car Driver Console Game

Car Driver Console Game is a simple console-based game where players control a car and earn points by accelerating or braking. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible before choosing to quit.

How to Play
Run the game by executing the compiled executable or running the program in an IDE that supports C#.

Once the game starts, you will see the title "Car Drive Game" displayed on the console.

Instructions will be provided on the console, prompting you to press 'A' to accelerate, 'B' to brake, or 'Q' to quit.

Press 'A' to accelerate and earn 10 points. The more you accelerate, the higher your score will be.

Press 'B' to brake and subtract 5 points from your score. Be careful not to brake excessively, as it will reduce your overall score.

If you want to quit the game at any time, press 'Q'. This will end the game and display your final score.

The game continues until you choose to quit by pressing 'Q'.

Game Features
Simple and intuitive controls: Accelerate with 'A', brake with 'B', and quit with 'Q'.
Real-time score tracking: The game keeps track of your score as you accelerate or brake.
Smooth gameplay: A short delay is introduced between each input to make the game playable.
Game Over screen: When you choose to quit, the game displays a "Game Over" message along with your final score.
